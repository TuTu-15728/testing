    <div class="intro">
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Fire safety and security are essential components of any building's safety plan, aimed at preventing fires
            and ensuring the well-being of occupants. Key measures include installing smoke detectors, fire alarms, and
            sprinkler systems, as well as ensuring clear and accessible exit routes. It's crucial to regularly maintain
            and inspect electrical systems, fire extinguishers, and emergency equipment to prevent malfunctions. Fire
            drills and safety training should be conducted to ensure everyone knows how to respond in case of an
            emergency. Additionally, following proper storage practices for flammable materials and adhering to local
            fire safety regulations helps minimize the risk of fire hazards.

        <h2>EVACUATION STRATEGIES</h2>
        <p>In the event of a fire, it's crucial to have a pre-arranged evacuation plan, in order to ensure a
            reasonable safety of human beings.
        </p>
        <p>Evacuation strategies act as a decisive factor in ensuring prompt and safe evacuation of the occupants.
        </p>
        <p>It also helps to deal with human behavioural aspects efficiently in the event of a fire and ensure
            optimum safety.</p>

        <div class="compartIntro">
            <p><strong>Compartmentation</strong> is a key element of passive fire protection, involving the use of
                fire-resistant
                materials to isolate parts of a building. This limits the spread of fire and smoke, confining it to a
                smaller area and preventing it from affecting other compartments.</p>

        <div class="barriersDes">
            <h2>Fire-resistant Barriers</h2>
            <p><strong>Wall Construction</strong></p>
            <p>Fire-resistant barriers such as concrete, plasterboard, and fire-resistant glass are used to create a
                division between areas, preventing fire from spreading across floors or between rooms.</p>
            <p><strong>Floor and Ceiling Barriers</strong></p>
            <p>Fire-resistant barriers are applied to floors and ceilings to contain fires vertically, particularly in
                multi-storey buildings, ensuring fires stay confined to one level.</p>
            <p><strong>Fire Resistance Ratings</strong></p>
            <p>These barriers are rated for their ability to withstand fire (e.g., FR30, FR60, FR90, FR120). Higher
                ratings provide greater protection, with more fire resistance time.</p>
            <p><strong>Compartment Sizes</strong></p>
            <p>The barriers divide a building into fire compartments based on its use, which limits the spread of fire
                and smoke and helps in fire containment.</p>
            <p><strong>Integration with Other Systems</strong></p>
            <p>Fire-resistant barriers must be designed to complement other fire safety systems, like fire doors and
                fire stopping, to create an effective passive fire protection system.</p>
            <p><strong>Building Codes Compliance</strong></p>
            <p>Fire-resistant barriers must meet local fire safety regulations and building codes to ensure the
                structure provides adequate protection.</p>

                    rooms and corridors or between stairways and halls.</strong></p><br>
            <p>For providing adequate protection through fire doors, the following needs to be implemented:
            </p>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>Fire doors should remain closed</li>
                <li>It should have fire resistant ratings, like FR30, FR60</li>
                <li>It should have intumescent strips and smoke seals to resist the passage of fire and smoke</li>
                <li>The glazing in the door should be fire rated</li>
                <li>It should have 3 hinges</li>
                <li>It should be fitted with self-closing device</li>
                <li>The door should always open in the direction of travel and should also open to 90 degrees</li>

        <h2>Fire Stopping Solutions</h2>
        <div class="fireStopSteps">
            <h3>Sealing Gaps and Voids</h3>
            <p>Fire stopping involves sealing gaps or openings around pipes, cables, ducts, and other penetrations to
                prevent the spread of fire and smoke through these spaces.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fireStopSteps">
            <h3>Materials Used</h3>
            <p>Intumescent sealants, fire-resistant foams, mineral wool, and fire-resistant boards are commonly used for
                fire stopping. These materials expand when exposed to heat, filling gaps and blocking fire and smoke
                from spreading.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fireStopSteps">
            <h3>Through-Penetration Protection</h3>
            <p>Fire stopping ensures that penetrations like pipes or cables passing through fire-resistant barriers do
                not compromise the fire-resistance integrity of the walls, floors, or ceilings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fireStopSteps">
            <h3>Ductwork and Ventilation Systems</h3>
            <p>Fire stopping is especially important in sealing ventilation ducts and service shafts. Fire dampers and
                intumescent coatings are used to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through these systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fireStopSteps">
            <h3>Building Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Key areas like electrical, plumbing, or mechanical services require fire stopping to prevent compromising
                the fire barriers around these penetrations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fireStopSteps">
            <h3>Regular Inspections and Maintenance</h3>
            <p>Fire stopping must be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure it remains intact, as seals can
                degrade over time, weakening the fire protection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fireStopSteps">
            <h3>Code Compliance</h3>
            <p>Fire stopping materials and techniques must comply with building codes and fire safety regulations to
                ensure their effectiveness and meet safety standards.

            <h3>Why Compartmentation is Crucial in High-Rise Buildings and Premises with Large Occupancies:</h3>
            <p><strong>Compliance with Building Codes</strong></p>
            <p>National and international building codes, including NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) and NBC
                (National Building Code), recognize fire compartmentation as a core element of fire safety design. It is
                a mandatory feature to ensure that buildings meet safety standards and regulations.</p>
            <p><strong>Fire Control and Risk Mitigation</strong></p>
            <p>Properly implemented compartmentation plays a critical role in controlling fire spread. It significantly
                reduces the potential loss of life and property damage by confining fire and smoke to a limited area,
                buying valuable time for evacuation and firefighting efforts.</p>
            <p><strong>Fire Risk Assessments</strong></p>
            <p>Compartmentation is a key component in fire risk assessments, which evaluate the effectiveness of a
                building’s fire safety measures. Ensuring that compartmentation meets the required standards is
                essential for maintaining the safety of both the occupants and the structure.</p>

            <h2>Means of Escape in Fire Safety</h2>
            <p><strong>"Ensuring safe evacuation of occupants in the event of fire is crucial."</strong></p>
            <p>The "means of escape" refers to a structural feature in a building designed to provide a safe route for
                occupants to reach a place of safety during a fire. This route must be accessible, well-lit, and
                adequately
                signed at all times, as required by the National Building Code (NBC). It is essential that the Available
                Safe Egress Time (ASET) exceeds the Required Safe Egress Time (RSET), ensuring all occupants—whether
                unaided
                or assisted—can reach a safe area before a life-threatening situation arises in the event of a fire.</p>
            <h3>The “means of escape” must have a fire resisting rating of at least 30 minutes to
                ensure safe evacuation of the occupants to the nearest place of safety.</h3>
