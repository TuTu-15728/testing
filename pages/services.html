            <h2>Fire Risk Management</h2>
            <p>Fire risk management involves identifying potential hazards and risks associated with fire in the
                premises. A comprehensive FRA helps eliminate or reduce these risks by implementing control measures.
                It’s essential to ensure the safety of all occupants and prevent any harm in the event of a fire
                emergency.</p>
